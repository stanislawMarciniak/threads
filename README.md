# Threads Clone App

This project is a clone of the Threads application. The project taught me how to use a NoSQL database and leverage the powerful Next.js SSR. It is built using TypeScript, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and Shadcn UI. For creating both users and groups, I used Clerk. Additionally, MongoDB manages threads, users, and groups. Project is fully responsive.
